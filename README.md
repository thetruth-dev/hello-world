# hello-world
 Hi people,
 
 I'm Dalton. I am generally a positive person. I take the time to enjoy the good things in life, things like love, friendship, parenthood, marriage, and play. I have a passion for learning, and have spent my life reading instruction manuals. I am learning to code and appreciate any help or mentorship given.
